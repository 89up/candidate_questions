Dear {{ candidate.name }},

We dread to think how many emails similar to this one you're receiving
right now. Since you're standing for Parliament, organisations and
individuals rightly want to know what you think on myriad issues, but
keeping up with their demands must be a challenge.

We sympathise, and we're trying to improve the situation. We're making a
system that lets organisations put questions to candidates, and lets
voters find your answers, without overwhelming your inbox.

Follow this link to jump straight to the questions organisations have
asked you already. The link is unique to you so please don't pass it on.
Anyone with this link will be able to answer questions as yourself!

If you'd like to share the project, please use this link instead:

http://questions.campaignreply.org/

The idea is that organisations will submit questions through our site,
and we will batch them up for you to answer, sending you a reminder to
visit the site weekly if you choose to participate.

Answering questions in batch-mode means you can be more efficient by
scheduling a chunk of time to process questions rather than being
interrupted constantly.

Collating your answers together on a single site lets voters see what
you've said on a range of issues at once - rather than individual
organisations promoting your platform piecemeal.

Organisations benefit too, as we will make the answers to their
questions available to embed on their own sites, meaning they can draw
them to their supporters' attention easily.

The system is a prototype, so we would love to hear your feedback and
suggestions for improvements, which you can give by replying to this
email. We will be continuing the work after the General Election and
we'll be releasing the code so that it can be used in future elections -
both in the UK and around the world.

organisations would like you to answer.

Good luck in the election!

everyone, its data will be open and free to reuse, and the software is
