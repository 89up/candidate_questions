# About

Election candidates can receive a huge volume of questions, from myriad organisations, about their positions on every aspect of life.

We'd like to help organisations ask their questions, and help voters find the answers, while reducing the noise for candidates.

The system allows organisations to specify questions through a web front-end. Candidates then receive occasional emails inviting them to respond to those questions in batches (to avoid overwhelming them). The public can search for candidates or consituencies and view any answers that have been supplied.

The data is exposed via a read-only API so that organisations can embed the answers to questions they've asked in their own sites. There may be other fun uses for this information too!

The system uses [PopIt](http://popit.poplus.org/) in the back end and should interoperate with other poplus components.
